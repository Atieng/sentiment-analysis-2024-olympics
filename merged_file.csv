Dear Hardik and Team,

I'm really proud of your effort. Thank you for giving us an electrifying, spine-tingling performance that was full of euphoria and goosebumps. I couldn't be grateful enough. Thank you for making us believe that India could play a Gold Medal match again after 1980.

As a fan, I take responsibility for not caring about this sport earlier. This sport is an emotion for all of us, but I promise we will rebuild as a nation and regain our heritage.

Part of the challenge for a WBB market is that CBS and Turner aren’t options with their holding of the Men’s Tournament while FOX may not have the channel space that ESPN can offer and it seems clear NBC was focused on other properties including the NBA. Value may be up but the suitors may have given ESPN leverage. Plus ESPN likely could leverage saying that if they spun off WBB elsewhere, they’d drop the value of the rest so low that the NCAA would end up bringing in less revenue in the end.

In medieval and early modern times, the Pope and other high ranking clergy were the objects of mockery and satire at European carnivals. Ritual transgression and mockery of social and religious norms performed an important collective psychological function. You can watch all about this on Episode 2 of The Wisdom of the Dream on Youtube, a 6 part series on Jung. Highly recommended.

This, IMO, is what was happening at the controversial 'Last Supper' episode of the Olympics opening ceremony. It was a hearkening back to an old European tradition. It was not woke, it was not perverted, but it was transgressive and blasphemous. More power to them. The reaction shows just how much we need it.

Then to beat the world No 1 & another competitor back to back is incomparable. And if then, by gross ill luck, you are overweight by a whisker, you are the target of sarcasm of ppl who’ve not played any sport beyond KG (or their street)!

Btw, an individual's body weight is sole responsibility of the individual. Others can only help in whatever manner they can.

1821478026590261710,"As the Paris Olympics continue to delight and amaze, here's an article in praise of intercultural dialogue and Franglais... As Euronews set out, hybrid languages are a key part of cultural integration.

Also known as “macaronic language”, some of the best known early examples were when Latin merged with local vernacular languages in Europe: ""While Latin was still the go-to language for religion and academia in the 12th century, vernacular language was becoming increasingly popular for poetry and storytelling, and writers started to combine the two in their works.""

Euronews say that ""Macaronic” itself comes a combination of Neo-Latin and Italian, from the peasant pasta (although others say it is more of a dumpling) that inspired the 15th century Padua poet Tifi Odasi’s work ‘Macaronea’ which used macarnoic language.

Today, some of the most common macaronic languages in Europe are combinations of local languages and English (Frenglish/Franglais etc), owing to the cultural prevalence of English as a global lingua franca.

'Loan words', hybridisation and macaronic language keep refreshing and updating languages - and help us share the best of different cultures.
The world needs a gold medal for that!

Despite a 3-1 extra-time defeat to host nation France, Egypt stands on the brink of winning their first Olympic football medal. They face Morocco, who previously beat them in the U23 Africa Cup of Nations final last summer.

The Pharaohs 🇪🇬 have a habit of starting strong, leading in three of their last four Olympic matches. However, their defense has struggled, failing to keep a clean sheet in their last three games. Coach Rogério Micale is determined to secure an Olympic medal, motivating his team to hold their lead if they strike first.

Morocco's 🇲🇦 semi-final story was similar; they led against Spain but lost 2-1. With no extra-time in their game, Morocco should be fresher. Despite internal conflicts with coach Walid Regragui, Morocco aims for their first Olympic medal, showing second-half vulnerabilities by conceding most goals after the break.",https://x.com/Boomerang_SB/status/1821477445045825854,tweet,Boomerang Sportsbook,@Boomerang_SB,,,,0,0,0,0,21,0,2024-08-08 12:23:58,https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GUcwD7aXsAAUm_P.jpg,
