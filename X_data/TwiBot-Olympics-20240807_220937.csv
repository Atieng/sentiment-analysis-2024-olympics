Part of the challenge for a WBB market is that CBS and Turner aren’t options with their holding of the Men’s Tournament while FOX may not have the channel space that ESPN can offer and it seems clear NBC was focused on other properties including the NBA. Value may be up but the suitors may have given ESPN leverage. Plus ESPN likely could leverage saying that if they spun off WBB elsewhere, they’d drop the value of the rest so low that the NCAA would end up bringing in less revenue in the end.

In medieval and early modern times, the Pope and other high ranking clergy were the objects of mockery and satire at European carnivals. Ritual transgression and mockery of social and religious norms performed an important collective psychological function. You can watch all about this on Episode 2 of The Wisdom of the Dream on Youtube, a 6 part series on Jung. Highly recommended.

This, IMO, is what was happening at the controversial 'Last Supper' episode of the Olympics opening ceremony. It was a hearkening back to an old European tradition. It was not woke, it was not perverted, but it was transgressive and blasphemous. More power to them. The reaction shows just how much we need it.
