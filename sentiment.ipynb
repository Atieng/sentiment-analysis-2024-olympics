    "- Social media data is noisy and unstructured presenting challenges for accurate analysis. \n",
    "- Distinguishing between positive, negative and neutral sentiments can be difficult especially when dealing with multilingual content thus affecting sentiment analysis accuracy\n",
    "- The volume of social media posts and comments can be overwhelming particularly during major events like the Olympics. Managing and processing large volumes of real-time data necessitates efficient data handling and processing techniques. \n",
    "- Interpreting context and sarcasm an extra layer of complexity as the sentiment expressed may not always align with the literal meaning of the words used. Social media content often includes informal language, slang and nuanced expressions that can skew sentiment analysis"
